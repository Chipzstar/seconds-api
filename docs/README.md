# About Seconds

**Seconds is a fully managed delivery service platform through API which you can easily and quickly access a multitude of delivery fleet providers with a single integration.**

Seconds's optimisation engine aggregates and guarantees the best provider for your business on an order to order basis. With our multi-provider aggregation and optimisation engine we are primed to increase your sales conversion by using different routing rules to select the best delivery partner that will be the cheapest, fastest, highest rating or best ETA, depending on your selection. Our smart engine ensures revenue gain with increased number of orders and improved delivery times.

#### API workflow

**The flow begins when your customer makes a delivery request or when you create one on the dashboard**

1. Your customer makes a **delivery request** or you **create** a delivery request
2. **Delivery information** is passed through to Seconds through our API or dashboard
3. Seconds **aggregates quotes** from all integrated delivery fleet providers that are within the coverage area of the delivery
4. Seconds then **optimises fleet selection** based on the selection strategy you select during your account setup such as; lowest price, fastest delivery time, highest fleet rating, etc.
5. You can track the **status** of the orders directly from the Seconds dashboard
